1.In my application more than one space-characters in a sentence are considered if it would be a one:
Sentence "Hello     java    world" will be splitted in words {"Hello", "java", "world"}
2.By default app reads input from System.in and writes it to System.out
3.stop words should also match a regex [a-zA-Z]+
4.If program is started with System.in, text will be read until EOF is reached
